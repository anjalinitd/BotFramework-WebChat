## Changelog Entry

## Changed

-  Added a tag attribute for from object for typing indicator.
<!-- Please paste your new entry from CHANGELOG.MD here. Entry is not required for work only related to development purposes. -->

## Description

-  BotFramework-webchat-adapter sends from object as part of typing indicator activity which is mapped to typing object in Botframeork-webchat. Added a new tag in adapter as well as webchat to pass tag to receiver side to indicate sender is typing in public/Internal panel. (We have a single adapter for two react webchat's one is public other is internal to distinguish between the two we need tag params)
